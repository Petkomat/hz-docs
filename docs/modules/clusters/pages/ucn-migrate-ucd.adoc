= Migrate from {ucd}
:description: You can continue to use your {ucd} implementations; {ucn} can operate with your existing member and client deployments. However, {ucn} improves and extends the capabilities of {ucd} and is applicable to more use cases. Hazelcast recommends that Enterprise Edition users deprecate their {ucd} implementations and migrate to using {ucn}.

{description}

To migrate your existing {ucd}, enable {ucn} and complete the configuration as described in the xref:clusters:ucn-enable.adoc[] topic.
