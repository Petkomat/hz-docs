:description: The previous method of dynamically loading custom classes or domain classes from other members, or deploying your code from your client was known as {ucd}. This method has been deprecated. The legacy information for the deprecated {ucd} solution has been retained in this section for your reference.

{description}

Open Source users must continue to use the deprecated {ucd} solution; {ucn} is only available to Enterprise Edition users.

Hazelcast recommends that Enterprise Edition users migrate to {ucn} to benefit from the improved and extended capabilities that it offers.

For further information on migrating from {ucd} to {ucn}, see the xref:clusters:ucn-migrate-ucd.adoc[] topic.

For further information on upgrading to Hazelcast Platform from IMDG, see the xref:migrate:upgrading-from-imdb-3.adoc[] or xref:migrate:upgrading-from-imdg-4.adoc[] topics.
